    "Engineers use math and science to design solutions to real-world problems, like safe bridges and clean water systems.",
    "A strong triangle shape is used in many towers and bridges because it spreads forces in a stable way.",
    "Engineers test new designs by building models and prototypes to find problems before making the final product.",
    "Materials like steel, concrete, and plastics are chosen based on properties such as strength, weight, and resistance to heat or rust.",
    "Civil engineers help plan roads, buildings, and dams so they can handle weather, traffic, and earthquakes.",
    "Electrical engineers design circuits that control devices from simple flashlights to computers and robots.",
    "Many engineers use computer-aided design (CAD) software to create detailed 3D drawings and make changes quickly."
