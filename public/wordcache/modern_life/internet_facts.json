    "The Internet is a global network that connects millions of smaller networks so computers can share information.",
    "Most websites use addresses called URLs, and the Domain Name System (DNS) helps turn names like \"example.com\" into number-based IP addresses.",
    "Data on the Internet is often broken into small pieces called packets that can travel different routes and get reassembled at the destination.",
    "Wi-Fi is a way to connect to the Internet without cables, but the signal still usually reaches the Internet through a wired network somewhere nearby.",
    "The World Wide Web is only one part of the Internet, because email, online games, and video calls can work without using web pages.",
    "HTTPS adds encryption to help keep information private when you visit a website, which is important for logins and payments.",
    "Because information travels through many computers and cables, Internet speed can change based on distance, congestion, and the quality of the connection."
