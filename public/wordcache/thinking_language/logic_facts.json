    "Logic is a way of thinking that helps you decide whether an argument makes sense based on reasons and evidence.",
    "In a logical argument, the reasons are called premises and the final statement you reach is called the conclusion.",
    "A syllogism is a classic logic pattern like: All mammals breathe air, dolphins are mammals, so dolphins breathe air.",
    "A statement can be logically valid even if it is not true, because validity is about the structure of the reasoning, not the facts.",
    "A contradiction happens when two statements cannot both be true at the same time, like saying a light is both on and not on.",
    "An if-then statement is called a conditional, and it links a condition to a result, such as: If it rains, then the ground gets wet.",
    "Common logic mistakes are called fallacies, like attacking a person instead of their idea, which is known as an ad hominem fallacy."
