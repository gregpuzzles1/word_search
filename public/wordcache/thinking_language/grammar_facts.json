    "The word \"grammar\" comes from a Greek word that originally meant \"the art of writing.\"",
    "In English, the order of words matters a lot, so \"The dog bit the man\" means something different from \"The man bit the dog.\"",
    "A sentence can be complete with just a subject and a verb, like \"Birds fly.\"",
    "Pronouns like \"I,\" \"she,\" and \"they\" help avoid repeating the same nouns over and over in writing.",
    "In English, the apostrophe in \"it's\" means \"it is,\" but \"its\" without an apostrophe shows ownership.",
    "Some adjectives can come before a noun or after a linking verb, like \"a happy kid\" and \"The kid is happy.\"",
    "Even though \"data\" is plural in Latin, in modern English it is often treated as singular in everyday use."
