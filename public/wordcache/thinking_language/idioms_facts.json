    "An idiom is a phrase whose meaning is different from the literal meaning of its words, like “spill the beans” meaning to reveal a secret.",
    "Idioms can be tricky for language learners because translating them word-for-word often makes no sense in another language.",
    "Many idioms come from old jobs and tools, such as “rule of thumb,” which is often linked to traditional ways of measuring with a thumb.",
    "Sports and games have inspired lots of idioms, including “throw in the towel,” which comes from boxing and means to give up.",
    "Some idioms use animals to create vivid pictures, like “the elephant in the room,” meaning a big problem everyone notices but avoids talking about.",
    "Idioms can change over time as culture changes, and some older idioms become less common when people forget their original stories.",
    "Different English-speaking countries sometimes use different idioms for the same idea, so a phrase popular in the U.S. might sound unusual in the U.K. or Australia."
