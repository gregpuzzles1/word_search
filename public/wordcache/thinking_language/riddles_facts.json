    "A riddle is a puzzle in words that makes you think beyond the literal meaning of a sentence.",
    "Many riddles use metaphor, comparing one thing to another to hide the answer in a clever way.",
    "Some riddles rely on homophones, which are words that sound the same but have different meanings, like \"knight\" and \"night.\"",
    "A common type of riddle is a \"what am I\" riddle, where clues describe an object, animal, or idea without naming it.",
    "Riddles have been shared for thousands of years, and one of the oldest famous riddle collections comes from an ancient text called the Exeter Book.",
    "Good riddles often include misdirection, giving clues that seem to point one way until you notice a hidden detail.",
    "Solving riddles can strengthen skills like vocabulary, logic, and careful reading because you must test different meanings of the clues."
