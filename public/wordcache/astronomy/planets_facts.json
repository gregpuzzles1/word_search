    "A planet is a large object in space that orbits a star and is round because its gravity pulls it into a ball shape.",
    "The four inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are rocky, while the four outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are mostly made of gases or icy materials.",
    "Mercury has the biggest temperature swings in our solar system because it has almost no atmosphere to hold in heat.",
    "Venus is the hottest planet, even hotter than Mercury, because its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere traps heat in a strong greenhouse effect.",
    "Jupiter is the largest planet and has a giant storm called the Great Red Spot that has lasted for centuries.",
    "Saturn’s rings are made of countless pieces of ice and rock, ranging from tiny grains to chunks as big as mountains.",
    "Uranus spins on its side, likely because of a huge collision long ago, which gives it very unusual seasons."
