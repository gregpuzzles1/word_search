    "A moon is a natural object that orbits a planet or a dwarf planet, held in place mainly by gravity.",
    "Earth has one moon, but some planets have many, like Jupiter and Saturn, which each have dozens of known moons.",
    "Our Moon always shows the same side to Earth because it rotates at the same rate that it orbits, a pattern called tidal locking.",
    "Moons can be very different sizes, from tiny rocky bodies to Ganymede, Jupiter’s largest moon, which is bigger than the planet Mercury.",
    "Some moons are geologically active, like Jupiter’s moon Io with its many volcanoes, and Saturn’s moon Enceladus with icy geysers.",
    "Scientists think tides on Earth happen mostly because of the Moon’s gravity pulling on our oceans as the Moon moves around our planet.",
    "A few moons may hide liquid water under ice, such as Europa and Enceladus, which makes them exciting places to search for signs of life."
