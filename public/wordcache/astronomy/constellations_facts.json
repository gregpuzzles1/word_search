    "A constellation is a named pattern of stars that helps people map and remember the night sky.",

    "There are 88 official constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union, covering the entire sky.",
    "Different constellations are visible in different seasons because Earth orbits the Sun and our nighttime view changes.",
    "Many constellation names come from ancient Greek and Roman stories, but other cultures have their own star patterns and legends.",
    "The North Star, Polaris, sits near the end of the Little Dipper’s handle and helps you find true north in the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "Constellation borders are like sky “countries,” so any object—like a planet or galaxy—can be located inside a constellation’s official area."
