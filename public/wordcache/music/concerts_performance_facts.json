    "A concert setlist is the planned order of songs, but artists sometimes change it during the show based on the audience’s energy or special requests.",
    "Applause and cheering can affect how performers play, because musicians often respond by extending solos or repeating a popular chorus.",
    "Large concerts use stage lighting cues and timed effects so that colors, spotlights, and visuals match the music’s rhythm and mood.",
    "Before performing, many artists do a soundcheck to test microphones, instruments, and speaker levels in the venue.",
