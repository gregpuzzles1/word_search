    "The song title \"Yesterday\" by The Beatles is one of the most covered songs in music history, with thousands of recorded versions.",
    "Many song titles use \"feat.\" or \"featuring\" to show that a guest artist also performed on the track.",
    "Song titles are usually not protected by copyright, so different artists can legally release songs with the same title.",
    "Some artists choose very short song titles, like \"One\" (U2) or \"Hello\" (Adele), to make them easy to remember and search.",
    "Some song titles include parentheses to add extra information, like a version name or an alternate phrase, such as \"(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction\" by The Rolling Stones.",
    "Clean or radio edit versions of songs sometimes have the same title but remove or change lyrics so they can be played on more stations.",
    "A concept album often has song titles that connect to a single story or theme across the whole album, like chapters in a book."
