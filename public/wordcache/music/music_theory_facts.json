    "An octave is the distance between two notes where the higher note vibrates at exactly twice the frequency of the lower note.",
    "A major scale follows the step pattern whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half.",
    "A minor scale often sounds sadder than a major scale because its third note is lower by one half step.",
    "A chord is made when three or more notes are played together, and a basic triad uses the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of a scale.",
    "Rhythm is organized using a time signature, like 4/4, which means four beats fit in each measure and the quarter note gets one beat.",
    "Sharps raise a note by one half step and flats lower a note by one half step.",
    "A key signature tells you which notes are sharp or flat throughout a song, helping musicians avoid writing the same symbols over and over."
