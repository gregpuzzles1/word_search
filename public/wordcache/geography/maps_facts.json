    "A map is a flat drawing that represents places on Earth and uses symbols to show features like roads, rivers, and cities.",
    "A map scale tells how distances on the map compare to real distances, such as 1 inch on the map equaling 10 miles in real life.",
    "The four main directions on most maps are north, south, east, and west, often shown with a compass rose.",
    "Latitude lines run east to west and measure how far north or south a place is from the Equator.",
    "Longitude lines run north to south and measure how far east or west a place is from the Prime Meridian.",
    "A legend (or key) explains what the map’s symbols and colors mean so you can understand what you are seeing.",
    "Because Earth is round, every flat map projection distorts something, such as size, shape, distance, or direction."
