    "The word “photography” comes from Greek words meaning “drawing with light.”",
    "Early photos in the 1800s often needed long exposure times, so people had to sit very still to avoid blur.",
    "A camera obscura is a dark box or room that projects an upside-down image through a small hole, and it helped inspire modern cameras.",
    "Exposure in photography is controlled by three main settings: aperture (how wide the lens opens), shutter speed (how long light enters), and ISO (how sensitive the sensor is).",
    "Black-and-white photos can still show strong contrast, patterns, and emotions even without color.",
    "Photojournalists use photography to document real events and tell stories, but they must follow rules about accuracy and fairness.",
    "Digital photos are made of tiny dots called pixels, and higher resolution usually means a clearer image when you zoom in or print it."
