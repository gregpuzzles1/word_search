    "An octave happens when a note’s sound wave vibrates at exactly twice the frequency of another note, which is why the two notes sound closely related.",
    "The modern piano can play very soft or very loud because its hammers hit the strings harder or softer depending on how you press the keys.",
    "A symphony is a long musical work for an orchestra, usually split into several movements that each have a different speed or mood.",
    "Jazz music grew in the United States by blending African rhythms, blues, and European instruments, and it often features improvisation, which means making music on the spot.",
