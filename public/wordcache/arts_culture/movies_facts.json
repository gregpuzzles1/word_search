    "Movies are made from many still pictures shown quickly, and playing them at about 24 frames per second makes motion look smooth to most people.",
    "Most films are created in three main stages: pre-production (planning), production (filming), and post-production (editing, sound, and visual effects).",
    "A storyboard is like a comic strip for a movie, helping directors and camera crews plan shots before filming begins.",
    "Foley artists make everyday sound effects, like footsteps or rustling clothes, by recording and syncing real noises to the action on screen.",
    "Animated movies can be made by drawing frames, moving models a tiny bit for stop-motion, or using computers to create 3D characters and worlds.",
    "Movie ratings and age guidelines are designed to help families choose films that match a viewer’s age and comfort level.",
    "Many modern movies use green screens so actors can be filmed in front of a plain background and then placed into new settings during editing."
