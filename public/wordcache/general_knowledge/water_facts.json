    "Only about 3% of Earth’s water is fresh, and much of that is locked up in ice and glaciers.",
    "Water expands when it freezes, which is why ice floats on liquid water.",
    "Because ice floats, it can form an insulating layer that helps lakes stay warmer below in winter.",
    "Water is called a universal solvent because it can dissolve more substances than most liquids.",
    "A water molecule is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, written as H2O."
