    "The first bicycles, built in the early 1800s, had no pedals and were pushed along the ground with your feet.",
    "A bicycle stays upright while moving because the wheels spinning help it balance and the rider makes small steering corrections.",
    "Bicycle gears change how hard you have to pedal, making it easier to climb hills or go faster on flat roads.",
    "Using hand signals can help cyclists communicate turns and stops to drivers and other riders, improving safety.",
    "A well-inflated tire reduces rolling resistance, which means you can travel farther using the same amount of effort.",
    "Helmets are designed to absorb impact energy, helping protect the brain during a fall or crash.",
    "Riding a bicycle produces no exhaust fumes, so it helps reduce air pollution compared with many motor vehicles."
