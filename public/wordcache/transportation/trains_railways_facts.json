    "The first public railway to carry passengers using steam locomotives opened in England in 1825.",
    "Trains can move huge loads efficiently because steel wheels rolling on steel rails create very little friction.",
    "Railway tracks are spaced at different widths around the world, and the most common is “standard gauge,” which is 1,435 millimeters apart.",
    "Electric trains often get power from overhead wires or a third rail, which helps them accelerate quickly and reduces air pollution at the train’s location.",
    "High-speed trains in some countries can travel over 300 kilometers per hour, faster than many cars on highways.",
    "Signals and track switches help keep trains safe by controlling which tracks trains use and warning engineers when to slow down or stop.",
    "Freight trains can be more than a kilometer long, and their cars are connected with strong couplers that can handle powerful pulling forces."
