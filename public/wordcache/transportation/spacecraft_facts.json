    "A spacecraft is a vehicle designed to travel and work in space, where there is almost no air.",
    "In space, spacecraft use rockets for thrust because rockets carry both fuel and oxygen and do not need air to burn.",
    "Most spacecraft use small thrusters to turn and stay pointed correctly, a job called attitude control.",
    "Satellites are a type of spacecraft that orbit planets to help with communication, weather forecasts, and GPS navigation.",
    "To survive reentry to Earth, a spacecraft needs a heat shield that protects it from extreme temperatures caused by fast-moving air.",
    "Some spacecraft use solar panels to make electricity from sunlight, which powers computers, heaters, and scientific tools.",
    "Space probes are unmanned spacecraft sent to explore faraway places like Mars or Jupiter and send data back to Earth by radio signals."
