    "Airplanes fly because their wings are shaped to create lift, a force that pushes up against gravity as air moves over and under the wing.",
    "Most passenger jets cruise at about 35,000 feet, where the air is thinner and the plane can fly more efficiently.",
    "A jet engine works by sucking in air, squeezing it, mixing it with fuel, and burning it to push hot gases backward and thrust the plane forward.",
    "Airplanes are steered on the ground with a nose wheel and brakes, but in the air pilots use movable parts like ailerons, elevators, and a rudder to turn and climb.",
    "Commercial airplanes are built with backup systems, so if one important part fails, another can often keep the plane operating safely.",
    "The black boxes on airplanes are actually bright orange flight recorders that help investigators understand what happened after an accident.",
    "Air traffic controllers use radar and radio to guide planes and keep safe distances between them, especially near busy airports."
