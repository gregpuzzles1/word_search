    "A boat is usually smaller than a ship, and ships are big enough to carry many people or heavy cargo across oceans.",
    "The oldest known boats were dugout canoes made by carving out a single large log thousands of years ago.",
    "Ship hulls are shaped to push water aside smoothly, which reduces drag and helps the ship move faster and use less fuel.",
    "A ship floats because it displaces a volume of water that weighs as much as the ship, following a rule called Archimedes’ principle.",
    "Many large ships use ballast water or heavy weights to stay stable and avoid tipping in rough waves.",
    "Modern container ships carry thousands of metal boxes called containers, which makes loading and unloading cargo much quicker.",
    "Submarines are ships that can dive underwater by filling special tanks with water to become heavier, then pumping the water out to rise again."
