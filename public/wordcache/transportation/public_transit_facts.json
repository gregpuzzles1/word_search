    "Riders often use a single ticket or pass to transfer between different routes, making it easier to travel across a city.",
    "Some cities give buses their own lanes or traffic-signal priority so they can move faster and stay on schedule.",
    "Transit maps are designed to be simple and easy to read, even if the routes are not drawn exactly to scale.",
